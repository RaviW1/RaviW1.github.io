I have again updated the website to look better an allow a better user experience. I have
returned to Jekyll after switching to Hugo. I had to port the old posts to the new site.
I used the Type-on-Strap theme to revamp the website. I switched from Hugo because I preferred
the themes available with Jekyll. Hugo is far simpler than Jekyll and took a lot longer
to set up. I did have some trouble with the audio embed from the previous post. 
I also improved some of the previous posts and redesigned my logo. I also had the opportunity
to revamp the portfolio section and create some quick designs for each of my projects. 
In the future I want to expand on the descriptions provided, however, I don't know how to 
do this without making the blog section redundant. With the full website redesign, I took
the time to create a simple graphic for the front page using blender and establish a color 
theme for the rest of the website. This may be subject to change.
I hope this is the last time I have to completely redesign the website, however, I do plan
on refining some elements.
