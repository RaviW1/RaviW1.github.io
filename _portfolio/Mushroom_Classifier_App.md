This project is my first introduction into computer vision and neural networks.
In this project, I made an iOS app that could detect if an image had a mushroom in it. 
I built the model in Python using Turi Create and I used CoreML to convert it into an app.  
The model has a 95.7% accuracy.
You can read more in the blog section.
